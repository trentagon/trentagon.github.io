# Creative coding.

One of my hobbies is making art with code. I mostly like to make [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art){:target="_blank"}, but I have also done some stuff with [datamoshing](http://datamoshing.com/about/){:target="_blank"}. I'd like to display some of my projects directly on this page, but I haven't figured out the best way to do it yet. Web development is not my specialty.

### Projects

[Crystal Bouquet](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/7163){:target="_blank"} \
The code that generates this animation takes a seed number as input and then randomly generates each flower's form, color, and movement. Because I made this at the height of the 2020-2022 cryptocurrency craze (lol), I turned it into an NFT that can be minted on the Tezos blockchain. The hash code for the transaction becomes the seed, so every edition on the blockchain is different.
