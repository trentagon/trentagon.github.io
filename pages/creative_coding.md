# Creative coding.

One of my hobbies is making art with code. I mostly like to make [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art){:target="_blank"}, but I have also done some stuff with [datamoshing](http://datamoshing.com/about/){:target="_blank"}. I'd like to display some of my projects directly on this page, but I haven't figured out the best way to do it yet. Web development is not my specialty.

Here is a tweet with a video of a project I made: [Crystal Bouquet](https://x.com/trentag0n_art/status/1482515912305504258?s=20){:target="_blank"}. \
The code that generates this animation takes a seed number as input and then randomly generates each flower's form, color, and movement. Because I made this at the height of the 2021/2022 cryptocurrency craze (lol), I turned it into an NFT that can be minted on the Tezos blockchain. The hash code for the transaction becomes the seed, so every edition on the blockchain is different. Anyway...
