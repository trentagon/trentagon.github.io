# Trent's Book Club: Community Guidelines

### The Mission.
Each month, we will all read the same book and then come to this book club to (1) discuss the book and (2) to hang out with friends. All are welcome.

Attendees of the book club can generally be classified into four categories:
- *The scholar* has thoroughly read the book and wants to have an in-depth discussion about their opinions and analyses.
- *The student* has read enough of the book to understand the general idea and wants to have a broad discussion.
- *The busybody* couldn’t find the time to read the book, but really wanted to. They’ve read the sparknotes and want to learn more about what happened in the book.
- *The homie* just wants to hang out and enjoy the vibes.

We all strive to be the scholar, but sometimes we can’t quite get there. That’s ok. Consider which category you fall into before each meeting and be respectful of those in other categories. Meetings will prioritize discussion of the book, but other topics are welcome.

### Book Selection.
There is one rule for book selection: the book must be good. Nobody wants to spend their time slogging through a bad book. Books will be selected based on member suggestions and discussion at each meeting.

### Meeting Schedule.
The group meets monthly - the exact date is specified before each meeting. We meet at varying places in the Seattle area and are always looking for hosts!

### Contact and Updates.
Book club information is disseminated by email and text message. To join, send Trent your name, phone number, and email address via text or email.
