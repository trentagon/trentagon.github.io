I use computers to study how planets work.

### Astrobiology and Planetary Science

Astrobiology is the study of the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe. It has been a part of NASA since the 1960's (then called "exobiology") and is the driving force behind many space exploration missions, including the [Perseverance rover on Mars](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/missions/2020-mars-rover/){:target="_blank"} and the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/missions/jwst/){:target="_blank"} (JWST).

Every planet is a complex system. Earth's behavior is a mosaic of interactions between the atmosphere (air), hydrosphere (ocean), geosphere (rocks), and biosphere (life). Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and the other planets in and out of our solar system are also complex systems, but with notable differences from Earth. By studying and comparing planets, we get closer to answering astrobiology questions like "how did life originate?", "how did life evolve to its modern state?", and "is there life elsewhere in the universe?".

### Ancient Mars

<!-- All known life requires liquid water. Modern Mars is cold and dry, but there was abundant liquid water on ancient Mars. We know this from two lines of evidence: (1) pictures of Mars's surface show geologic features that resulted from flowing liquid water, like ancient river valleys and deltas; (2) chemical analysis from Mars rovers has revealed the presence of minerals that can only form when there is liquid water. Organisms on Earth occupy a wide range of environments: from acid mine drainage, to deep sea trenches, to permafrost ice. The one thing that all of these organisms have in common is that they need liquid water to grow, survive, and thrive. So, when we search for life on other planets, it is our first instinct to search for places that have liquid water. This is what makes ancient Mars so interesting: It is the only place in the history of the solar system - besides Earth - where we have evidence for liquid water on the surface of a planet or moon. Thus, the overarching scientific question regarding ancient Mars is: did ancient Mars have the conditions to support life? If so, was ancient Mars inhabited? -->

Modern Mars is cold and dry, but there is abundant evidence that oceans, rivers, and lakes were present on ancient Mars. Organisms on Earth occupy a wide range of environments: from acid mine drainage, to deep sea trenches, to permafrost ice - the one thing that all of these organisms have in common is that they need liquid water to grow, survive, and thrive. Thus, ancient Mars may have been a habitable environment, and may have even been inhabited. I study how the surface environment and atmosphere of ancient Mars has changed over time, with the goal of providing geologic context for its potential habitability.

### Earth's Neoproterozoic Era

The Neoproterozoic Era on Earth is the time period from 540 million years ago to 1 billion years ago. During this time, Earth went through several dramatic global changes: (1) widespread ice sheets covered the planet in the "Snowball Earth" events, (2) atmospheric oxygen rose by several orders of magnitude, and (3) large, complex organisms appeared in the fossil record for the first time. I study these global changes, try to untangle their relationship, and find their potential causes.

### The TRAPPIST-1 Exoplanet System

Exoplanets are planets that orbit stars other than our sun. TRAPPIST-1 is an exoplanet system that consists of an ultracool M dwarf star with 7 transiting, terrestrial planets that are remarkably similar to Earth in mass, radius, and recieved stellar radiation. It is likely that these planets are representative of a larger planet population considering that stars like TRAPPIST-1a are common in the galaxy. Thus, it is critical to understand the capability of planets orbiting ultracool dwarf stars to sustain secondary atmospheres and host habitable surface conditions when searching for life outside of our solar system. I investigate these topics by observing and characterizing the TRAPPIST-1 planets.
