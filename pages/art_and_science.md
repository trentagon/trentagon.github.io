# Art & Science

I like to make art with code. I mostly like to make [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art){:target="_blank"}, but I have also done some [datamoshing](http://datamoshing.com/about/){:target="_blank"}. 

## Projects

[Crystal Bouquet](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/7163){:target="_blank"} \
The code that generates this animation takes a seed number as input and then randomly generates each flower's form, color, and movement. Because I made this at the height of the 2020-2022 cryptocurrency craze (lol), I turned it into an NFT that can be minted on the Tezos blockchain. The hash code for the transaction becomes the seed, so every edition on the blockchain is different.

## Teaching

I designed and taught a class called "Generative Design: Making Art with Code" at the Coyote Central youth arts organization. The class was 20 hours long, taught over 5 days, with 8 students aged 10-15 and no prior coding experience. It is remarkable how much they learned and what they were able to accomplish, shown below.
