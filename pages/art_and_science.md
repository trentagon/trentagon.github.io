# Art & Science

I am passionate about the intersection of art and science. I think there is a lot more to be done in this realm. There's a reason most universities group humanities and science majors into the same [college](https://www.college.ucla.edu/about/).

## Projects

I like to make art with code. I mostly like to make [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art){:target="_blank"}, but I have also done some [datamoshing](http://datamoshing.com/about/){:target="_blank"}.

[View in fullscreen.](animation/index.html) This is some code I wrote that randomly generates each flower's form, color, and movement. Because I made this at the height of the 2020-2022 cryptocurrency craze (lol), I turned it into an [NFT](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/7163){:target="_blank"} that can be minted on the Tezos blockchain. The hash code for the transaction becomes the seed, so every edition on the blockchain is different.

## Teaching

I designed and taught a class called "Generative Design: Making Art with Code" at the Coyote Central youth arts organization. The class was 20 hours long, taught over 5 days, with 8 students aged 10-15 and no prior coding experience. It is remarkable how much they learned and what they were able to accomplish, shown below.
