# Art & Science

Art and science are often separated in the world and in peoples' minds. I don't see this distinction so strongly, and I am passionate about creating, exploring, and sharing areas where art and science intersect. After all, art and science have been indistinguishable for much of [human history](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/embr.201847061){:target="\_blank"}.

<!-- ## Projects

I like to make art with code. I mostly like to make [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art){:target="_blank"}, but I have also done some [datamoshing](http://datamoshing.com/about/){:target="_blank"}.  -->

## Crystal Bouquet

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
  <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"

</div>

[**[View in fullscreen]**](/assets/cb_jsMode/index.html){:target="\_blank"} I created crystal bouquet using JavaScript and the p5.js library. Each flower's form, color, and movement is randomly generated endlessly. The code for this animation is running in your browser right now.

<!-- Crystal bouquet was previously made as an [NFT](https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/7163){:target="_blank"} on the Tezos blockchain. The hash code for the transaction becomes the seed, so every edition on the blockchain is different. -->

I teach an original class called **Generative Design: Making Art with Code** at the Coyote Central youth arts organization in Seattle, WA. The class is 20 hours long, taught over 5 days, with 7-8 students aged 10-15 and no prior coding experience. It is remarkable how much they learn and what they were able to accomplish with their final projects (see videos).

## Publication Posters and Data Sculptures

_Coming soon_

I am in the process of creating posters and data sculptures to accompany my Ph.D. dissertation. I will populate this section as I finish them.
