# About me.

I am Trent B. Thomas. \
I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington. \
I am based out of Seattle (95%) and Philadelphia (5%). \
I am from Southern New Jersey. \
I am a diehard fan of Philadelphia sports teams, as painful as it may be. \
I am an avid soccer player. \
I am interested in chess and self-sustaining aquariums. \
I am a cat person.

My website looks this way because \
I am a fan of digital brutalism. \
I am tired of noisy, inefficient user interfaces. \
I am inspired by [Berkeley Graphics](){:target="_blank"}, [Tanner](https://t0.vc){:target="_blank"}, [Yossarian](https://yossarian.net){:target="_blank"}, and the [10kb](https://10kbclub.com){:target="_blank"}, [250kb](https://250kb.club){:target="_blank"}, [512kb](https://512kb.club){:target="_blank"}, and [1mb](https://1mb.club){:target="_blank"} clubs.
