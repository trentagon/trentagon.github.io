# About me

Hello, I am Trent B. Thomas. I am originally from a town in Southern New Jersey just outside of Camden, NJ and Philadelphia, PA. Because of this, I am a diehard fan of all Philadelphia sports teams, as painful as it may be. In my free time, I am an avid soccer player, runner, and reader.
